         &quot;\nWelcome Traveler, care to play a game of mysteries? He says, gesturing the woven mat in front of him with an enigmatic smile. &quot; + 
         &quot;\nYou eye the three chests on the mat with interest, finding yourself asking what you have to do. &quot; + 
         &quot;\nIn one of these chests there is a valuable tresure. You get to choose only one to open and you gain whatever is inside. &quot; + 
         &quot;But beware, only one is a lucky choice, the others only contains missfortune. &quot; + 
         &quot;\nYou cannot resist and against your better judgement you agree to the game. \nYou have trouble deciding so you fish a die from your pocket to help you out.&quot;);
